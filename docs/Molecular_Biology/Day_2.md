## 1. Introduction to molecular biology

**Molecular biology** is a discipline at the intersection between *biochemistry* and *cellular biology*:

- Molecular biology, per formal definition, studies nucleic acids but in general deals with the interactions among bio-macromolecules
- Biochemistry, per definition, studies proteins, but in general deals with the metabolic interactions in a cell, often involving macro and micro-molecules
- Cellular biology studies the organization and macro-processes that occur within a cell
