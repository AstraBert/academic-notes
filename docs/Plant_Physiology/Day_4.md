## 1. Plant Life Cycle

Plants have two types of growth:

- **Determined growth**, which usually involves organs that have a final stage of differentiation with a **well defined size**, such as flowers, fruits or leaves. The number of cells reaches a certain threshold and remains stable from there, while cells can still elongate (*elongation growth*).
- **Non-determined growth**, that involves the trunk and the and the roots of the plant. They both have the so-called apical meristem, which promotes their growth indefinitely. The apical meristem of the trunk descends to form the leaves primordia, which help the formation of leaves along with the leaves meristem. On the other hand, in the roots, meristem cells go up to form roots organs such as root hairs.

Meristems can be **primary** or **secondary** (although secondary growth is not common to all the plants): the first ones are the apical meristems (Shoot Apical Meristem - or SAM, and Root Apical Meristem - or RAM[^1]), the other ones are known as lateral meristems and promote the volumetric growth of the trunk (only in species belonging to the *Gymnospermata* taxon).

Primary growth then corresponds to an *elongation growth* (for the entire organism, not to be mistaken with the *cellular* elongation growth), whereas the secondary growth is linked to an increase in the diameter of the plant, both in the roots and in the wooden portion of the trunk.

As you can see, there are several regions related to the meristem (here we have the root meristem). There is an organization center, which is layered to set the cells growth in the correct patterns, and the quiescent center, that controls cellular proliferation to avoid cancerous growth.
