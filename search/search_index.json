SEL was studied by using color tracers with different dimensions. </p> <p>Some pathogens have adapted their systems to bio-hack the symplastic transport by modifying the SEL, using movements proteins that are able to enlarge the plasmodesmata and let the nuclear material from the pathogens pass (they generally are viruses, such as the Tobacco Mosaic Virus). </p> <p>Plants generally use callose (a poly-saccharide similar to cellulose) to close the enlarged plasmodesmata when they sense a pathogenic invasion: callose synthase is the enzyme that takes care of producing the saccharide, while $\\beta$ -1,3-glucanase is the enzyme that degrades it. </p>"},{"location":"Plant_Physiology/Day_1/#2b-cytoskeleton","title":"2b.
